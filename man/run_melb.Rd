\usage{
run_melb(year = NULL, sensor = NULL, tz = "", na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{An integer or a vector of integers. By default, it's the current #'   year.}

\item{sensor}{Sensor names. By default, it pulls all the sensors.}

\item{tz}{Time zone. By default, "" is the current time zone. For this dataset,
the local time zone is "Australia/Melbourne" which would be the most
appropriate, depending on OS.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. \code{FALSE} is the default suggesting to include \code{NA} in #'   the datset. \code{TRUE} removes the \code{NA}s.}
}
\value{
A data frame including these variables as follows:
\itemize{
\item Sensor: Sensor name (45 sensors up to date)
\item Date_Time: Date time when the pedestrian counts are recorded
\item Date: Date associated with Date_Time
\item Time: Time of day
