# rwalkr

The goal of **rwalkr** is to provide APIs to the pedestrian data from the City of Melbourne in tidy data form.

## Installation

You could install the stable version from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rwalkr")
```

You could install the development version from Github using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("earowang/rwalkr")
```

## Usage

### APIs

There are two APIs available to access Melbourne pedestrian data: *compedapi* and *Socrata*. The former drives the `walk_melb()` function, where counts are uploaded on a daily basis; the latter powers the `run_melb()` function, where counts are uploaded on a monthly basis. Given the function names, the function `run_melb()` pulls the data at a much faster speed than `walk_melb()`.

The function `walk_melb()` specifies the starting and ending dates to be pulled, whereas `run_melb()` requires years to define the time frame. If a selection of sensors are of interest, `run_melb()` provides the flexibility for sensor choices.

```{r data}
library(rwalkr)
start_date <- as.Date("2017-07-01")
# tweak = TRUE gives the consistent sensors to the ones from run_melb().
# By default it's FALSE for back compatibility.
ped_walk <- walk_melb(from = start_date, to = start_date + 6L, tweak = TRUE)
ped_walk
ped_run <- run_melb(year = 2016:2017, sensor = NULL) # NULL means all sensors
ped_run
```

There are missing values (i.e. `NA`) in the dataset. By setting `na.rm = TRUE` in both functions, missing values will be removed.

Here's an example to use *ggplot2* for visualisation:

```{r plot, fig.height = 4}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = subset(ped_walk, Sensor == "Melbourne Central")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date_Time, y = Count))
```

It's worth noting that some sensor names are coded differently by these two APIs. The argument `tweak = TRUE` ensures the sensor names returned by `walk_melb()` consistent to the ones in `run_melb()` and `pull_sensor()`, both of which are supported by Socrata. The dictionary for checking sensor names between two functions is available through `lookup_sensor()`.

It's recommended to include an application token in `run_melb(app_token = "YOUR-APP-TOKEN")`, which you can sign up [here](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/profile/app_tokens).

### Shiny app

The function `shine_melb()` launches a shiny app to give a glimpse of the data. It provides two basic plots: one is an overlaying time series plot, and the other is a dot plot indicating missing values. Below is a screen-shot of the shiny app.
