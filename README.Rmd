# pedestrian

The goal of pedestrian is to provide API to the pedestrian data from the City of Melbourne in tidy data form.

## Installation

You could install the development version from Github using

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("earowang/walker")
```

## Usage

Currently there is only one function in the package, `walk_melb()`. The starting and ending date inform which period to be scraped.

```{r}
library(walker)
start_date <- as.Date("2017-07-01")
end_date <- start_date + 6
ped <- walk_melb(from = start_date, to = end_date)
head(ped)
```
