# pedestrian

The goal of pedestrian is to provide API to the pedestrian data from the City of Melbourne in tidy data form.

## Installation

You could install the development version from Github using

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("earowang/pedestrian")
```

## Usage

Currently there is only one function in the package, `get_pedestrian()`. The starting and ending date inform which period to be scraped.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_pedestrian()
get_pedestrian(from = as.Date("2017-01-01"), to = as.Date("2017-02-28"))
```
